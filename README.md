# STAR WARS

### How to beat it:
1. Regardless of the character you select, the key is who you choose to fight first.
2. Pick the highest health character - it's not a trap! You can click on "More Info" which is a popup that contains the information of a character, along with an API call
3. Loop through the next highest health character
4. Pick the last one and you'll win.

# WINNER

### Other notes:
1. Leveraged bootstrap 4 for simplicity and speed - getting used to it now
2. Leveraged the Star Wars API, aka SWAPI and an AJAX call (simple)
3. Font awesome icons I used several times - pretty handy! Even had a jedi / sith icon.
